This project is a collection of JavaScript exercises and solutions that I created to practice and improve my coding skills. I also learned how to use GitHub to store, manage, and share my code online. 
This project demonstrates my ability to write clean, efficient, and beginner-friendly code in JavaScript, as well as my passion for learning new technologies and solving problems. 
You can view my code on GitHub
